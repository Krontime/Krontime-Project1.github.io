## Overview
 
### What is this website for?
 
This page was created as a coding project in 2018! It was made to heml people find EDM music for the people who:
1. Artists to get there name out there.
2. Looking for small (or big) house parties, or to have people come to house parties!
3. Artists to meet people.

It is also a place for people who know nothing or a lot about EDM to find new genres and artists that go along with them!
